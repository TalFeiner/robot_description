Data:

----------------
Batch include:

pixel_Velocity : Numpy matrix, dimentions: [400,400,3,T]. T: Number of frames. For each frame t in T, it present each pixel 3D velocity in the gazebo world. To change into picture velocity:

[vx,vy,vz] world -> [-vy,vz,-vx] picture.
-vx world = vz picture -> z- depth dimention' positive outside the picture. 

Time_Stamp: Numpy array, dimentions: [1,T]. For each frame t in T, it present how much time has passed since the first frame. (Time_Stamp[1,0]=0)


To import batch data:

from scipy.io import loadmat

data = loadmat("name_of_batch")

pixel_Velocity = data['pixel_Velocity']
Time_Stamp = data['Time_Stamp']
